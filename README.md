# Task Manager Website
## Author
Abdul Aziz Nassor

## Description

In the later semester of my second year in university, we were tasked with creating a high-fidelity website prototype for a task manager application. This website would include a homepage, account sign-up/log-in, task managing functions such as creating tasks, calender etc.

High-fidelity means that it would have to look similar to the final design however, as it is only a prototype, it is only visually there and most buttons do not work (as well as not having a database linked).

## Installation

Go onto Github, find the project and clone the repository.
Afterwards, open bash, locate the destinated file with 'cd', and use git clone on the cloned repository.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aanassor1/Task-Manager-Website.git
```

After, just click on views/index.html and check around the website.
